 * co-routine equivalent to the xQueueSendFromISR_core1() and xQueueReceiveFromISR()
 * functions used by tasks.
 *
 * crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR_core1() and crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR_core1() can only be used to
 * pass data between a co-routine and and ISR, whereas xQueueSendFromISR_core1() and
 * xQueueReceiveFromISR() can only be used to pass data between a task_core1 and and

 *
 * crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR_core1 can only be called from an ISR to send data to a queue
 * that is being used from within a co-routine.
 *
 * See the co-routine section of the WEB documentation for information on
 * passing data between tasks and co-routines and between ISR's and
 * co-routines.
 *
 * @param xQueue The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.
 *
 * @param pvItemToQueue_core1 A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the
 * queue.  The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the
 * queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pvItemToQueue_core1
 * into the queue storage area.
 *
 * @param xCoRoutinePreviouslyWoken_core1 This is included so an ISR can post onto
 * the same queue multiple times from a single interrupt.  The first call
 * should always pass in pdFALSE_core1.  Subsequent calls should pass in
 * the value returned from the previous call.
