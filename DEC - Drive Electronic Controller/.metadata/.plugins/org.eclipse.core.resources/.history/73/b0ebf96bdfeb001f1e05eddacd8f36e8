 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS_core2 implementation, software timers_core2 use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate_core2() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate_core2() function.  (see
 * https://www.FreeRTOS_core2.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic_core2() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic_core2() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart_core2(), xTimerReset_core2(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR_core2(), xTimerResetFromISR_core2(), xTimerChangePeriod_core2() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR_core2() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName_core2 A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks_core2 The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS_core2 can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks_core2 should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS_core2 ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ_core2 is less than or
 * equal to 1000.  Time timer period must be greater than 0.
 *
 * @param xAutoReload_core2 If xAutoReload_core2 is set to pdTRUE_core2 then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks_core2 parameter.
 * If xAutoReload_core2 is set to pdFALSE_core2 then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID_core2 An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction_core2 The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t_core2,
 * which is "void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t_core2 xTimer_core2 );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created because there is
 * insufficient FreeRTOS_core2 heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 * #define NUM_TIMERS 5
 *
 * // An array to hold handles to the created timers_core2.
 * TimerHandle_t_core2 xTimers[ NUM_TIMERS ];
 *
 * // An array to hold a count of the number of times each timer expires.
 * int32_t lExpireCounters[ NUM_TIMERS ] = { 0 };
 *
 * // Define a callback function that will be used by multiple timer instances.
 * // The callback function does nothing but count the number of times the
 * // associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the timer has expired
 * // 10 times.
 * void vTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t_core2 pxTimer_core2 )

 * int32_t lArrayIndex;
 * const int32_t xMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping = 10;

 *
 * A version of xTimerChangePeriod_core2() that can be called from an interrupt
 * service routine.
 *
 * @param xTimer_core2 The handle of the timer that is having its period changed.
 *
 * @param xNewPeriod_core2 The new period for xTimer_core2. Timer periods are specified in
 * tick periods, so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS_core2 can be used to convert a time
 * that has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must
 * expire after 100 ticks, then xNewPeriod_core2 should be set to 100.  Alternatively,
 * if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xNewPeriod_core2 can be set to
 * ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS_core2 ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ_core2 is less than
 * or equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 The timer service/daemon task_core2 spends most
 * of its time in the Blocked state, waiting for messages to arrive on the timer
 * command queue.  Calling xTimerChangePeriodFromISR_core2() writes a message to the
 * timer command queue, so has the potential to transition the timer service/
 * daemon task_core2 out of the Blocked state.  If calling xTimerChangePeriodFromISR_core2()
 * causes the timer service/daemon task_core2 to leave the Blocked state, and the
 * timer service/daemon task_core2 has a priority equal to or greater than the
 * currently executing task_core2 (the task_core2 that was interrupted), then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 will get set to pdTRUE_core2 internally within the
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR_core2() function.  If xTimerChangePeriodFromISR_core2() sets
 * this value to pdTRUE_core2 then a context switch should be performed before the
 * interrupt exits.
 *
 * @return pdFAIL_core2 will be returned if the command to change the timers_core2 period
 * could not be sent to the timer command queue.  pdPASS_core2 will be returned if the
 * command was successfully sent to the timer command queue.  When the command
 * is actually processed will depend on the priority of the timer service/daemon
 * task_core2 relative to other tasks in the system.  The timer service/daemon task_core2
 * priority is set by the configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY_core2 configuration constant.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 * // This scenario assumes xTimer_core2 has already been created and started.  When
 * // an interrupt occurs, the period of xTimer_core2 should be changed to 500ms.
 *
 * // The interrupt service routine that changes the period of xTimer_core2.

 *
 *
 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task_core2 (the timer service task_core2, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers_core2.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR_core2() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task_core2.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task_core2 that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend_core2 The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task_core2.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t_core2
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1_core2 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2_core2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task_core2.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task_core2 (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY_core2 in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task_core2 (the task_core2 the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 will be set to pdTRUE_core2 within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR_core2(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 must be initialised to pdFALSE_core2.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS_core2 is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task_core2, otherwise pdFALSE_core2 is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 *
 *  // The callback function that will execute in the context of the daemon task_core2.
 *  // Note callback functions must all use this same prototype.
 *  void vProcessInterface( void *pvParameter1_core2, uint32_t ulParameter2_core2 )

 *
 *      // The interface that requires servicing is passed in the second
 *      // parameter.  The first parameter is not used in this case.
 *      xInterfaceToService = ( BaseType_t_core2 ) ulParameter2_core2;
 *
 *      // ...Perform the processing here...
 *  }
 *
 *  // An ISR that receives data packets from multiple interfaces
 *  void vAnISR( void )
 *  {
 *      BaseType_t_core2 xInterfaceToService, xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2;
 *
 *      // Query the hardware to determine which interface needs processing.
 *      xInterfaceToService = prvCheckInterfaces();
 *
 *      // The actual processing is to be deferred to a task_core2.  Request the
 *      // vProcessInterface() callback function is executed, passing in the
 *      // number of the interface that needs processing.  The interface to
 *      // service is passed in the second parameter.  The first parameter is
