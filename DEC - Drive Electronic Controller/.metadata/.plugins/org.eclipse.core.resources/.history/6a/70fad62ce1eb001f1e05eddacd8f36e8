/*
 * Message buffers build functionality on top of FreeRTOS_core0 stream buffers.
 * Whereas stream buffers are used to send a continuous stream of data from one
 * task_core0 or interrupt to another, message buffers are used to send variable
 * length discrete messages from one task_core0 or interrupt to another.  Their
 * implementation is light weight, making them particularly suited for interrupt
 * to task_core0 and core to core communication scenarios.
 *
 * ***NOTE***:  Uniquely among FreeRTOS_core0 objects, the stream buffer
 * implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers
 * are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task_core0 or
 * interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task_core0 or
 * interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the
 * writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other
 * FreeRTOS_core0 objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or
 * multiple different readers.  If there are to be multiple different writers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferSend_core0()) inside a critical section and set the send
 * block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive
 * timeout to 0.
 *
 * Message buffers hold variable length messages.  To enable that, when a
 * message is written to the message buffer an additional sizeof( size_t ) bytes
 * are also written to store the message's length (that happens internally, with
 * the API function).  sizeof( size_t ) is typically 4 bytes on a 32-bit
 * architecture, so writing a 10 byte message to a message buffer on a 32-bit
 * architecture will actually reduce the available space in the message buffer
 * by 14 bytes (10 byte are used by the message, and 4 bytes to hold the length
 * of the message).

 *
 * An interrupt safe version of the API function that receives a discrete
 * message from a message buffer.  Messages can be of variable length and are
 * copied out of the buffer.
 *
 * ***NOTE***:  Uniquely among FreeRTOS_core0 objects, the stream buffer
 * implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers
 * are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task_core0 or
 * interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task_core0 or
 * interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the
 * writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other
 * FreeRTOS_core0 objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or
 * multiple different readers.  If there are to be multiple different writers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferSend_core0()) inside a critical section and set the send
 * block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive
 * block time to 0.
 *
 * Use xMessageBufferReceive_core0() to read from a message buffer from a task_core0.  Use
 * xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() to read from a message buffer from an
 * interrupt service routine (ISR).
 *
 * @param xMessageBuffer_core0 The handle of the message buffer from which a message
 * is being received.
 *
 * @param pvRxData_core0 A pointer to the buffer into which the received message is
 * to be copied.
 *
 * @param xBufferLengthBytes_core0 The length of the buffer pointed to by the pvRxData_core0
 * parameter.  This sets the maximum length of the message that can be received.
 * If xBufferLengthBytes_core0 is too small to hold the next message then the message
 * will be left in the message buffer and 0 will be returned.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0  It is possible that a message buffer will
 * have a task_core0 blocked on it waiting for space to become available.  Calling
 * xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() can make space available, and so cause a task_core0
 * that is waiting for space to leave the Blocked state.  If calling
 * xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() causes a task_core0 to leave the Blocked state, and
 * the unblocked task_core0 has a priority higher than the currently executing task_core0
 * (the task_core0 that was interrupted), then, internally,
 * xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() will set *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 to pdTRUE_core0.
 * If xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() sets this value to pdTRUE_core0, then normally a
 * context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited.  That will
 * ensure the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority Ready state
 * task_core0.  *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 should be set to pdFALSE_core0 before it is
 * passed into the function.  See the code example below for an example.
 *
 * @return The length, in bytes, of the message read from the message buffer, if
 * any.
 *
 * Example use:
 * @code{c}
 * // A message buffer that has already been created.
 * MessageBuffer_t xMessageBuffer_core0;
 *
 * void vAnInterruptServiceRoutine( void )
 * {
 * uint8_t ucRxData[ 20 ];
 * size_t xReceivedBytes;
 * BaseType_t_core0 xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 = pdFALSE_core0;  // Initialised to pdFALSE_core0.
 *
 *  // Receive the next message from the message buffer.
 *  xReceivedBytes = xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0( xMessageBuffer_core0,
 *                                                ( void * ) ucRxData,
 *                                                sizeof( ucRxData ),
 *                                                &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 );
 *
 *  if( xReceivedBytes > 0 )
 *  {
 *      // A ucRxData contains a message that is xReceivedBytes long.  Process
 *      // the message here....
 *  }
 *
 *  // If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 was set to pdTRUE_core0 inside
 *  // xMessageBufferReceiveFromISR_core0() then a task_core0 that has a priority above the
 *  // priority of the currently executing task_core0 was unblocked and a context
 *  // switch should be performed to ensure the ISR returns to the unblocked
 *  // task_core0.  In most FreeRTOS_core0 ports this is done by simply passing
 *  // xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core0 into portYIELD_FROM_ISR_core0(), which will test the
 *  // variables value, and perform the context switch if necessary.  Check the
 *  // documentation for the port in use for port specific instructions.
