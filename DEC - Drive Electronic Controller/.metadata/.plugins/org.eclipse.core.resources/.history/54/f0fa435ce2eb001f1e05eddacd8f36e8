/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task_core2 can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task_core2 can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task_core2
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a
 * 'rendezvous').

 * using xEventGroupCreateStatic_core2() then the application writer must instead

 * xEventGroupCreateStatic_core2() therefore allows an event group to be created
 * without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Although event groups are not related to ticks, for internal implementation
 * reasons the number of bits available for use in an event group is dependent
 * on the configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS_core2 setting in FreeRTOSConfig.h.  If
 * configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS_core2 is 1 then each event group contains 8 usable bits (bit
 * 0 to bit 7).  If configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS_core2 is set to 0 then each event group has
 * 24 usable bits (bit 0 to bit 23).  The EventBits_t_core2 type is used to store
 * event bits within an event group.
 *
 * @return If the event group was created then a handle to the event group is

 *
 * A version of xEventGroupSetBits_core2() that can be called from an interrupt.
 *
 * Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic operation because there
 * are an unknown number of tasks that may be waiting for the bit or bits being
 * set.  FreeRTOS_core2 does not allow nondeterministic operations to be performed in
 * interrupts or from critical sections.  Therefore xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR_core2()
 * sends a message to the timer task_core2 to have the set operation performed in the
 * context of the timer task_core2 - where a scheduler lock is used in place of a
 * critical section.
 *
 * @param xEventGroup_core2 The event group in which the bits are to be set.
 *
 * @param uxBitsToSet_core2 A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to set.
 * For example, to set bit 3 only, set uxBitsToSet_core2 to 0x08.  To set bit 3
 * and bit 0 set uxBitsToSet_core2 to 0x09.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task_core2.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task_core2 is higher than the priority of the
 * currently running task_core2 (the task_core2 the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 will be set to pdTRUE_core2 by
 * xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR_core2(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 must be initialised to pdFALSE_core2.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return If the request to execute the function was posted successfully then
 * pdPASS_core2 is returned, otherwise pdFALSE_core2 is returned.  pdFALSE_core2 will be returned
 * if the timer service queue was full.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code{c}
 * #define BIT_0 ( 1 << 0 )
 * #define BIT_4 ( 1 << 4 )
 *
 * // An event group which it is assumed has already been created by a call to
 * // xEventGroupCreate_core2().
 * EventGroupHandle_t_core2 xEventGroup_core2;
 *
 * void anInterruptHandler( void )
 * {
 * BaseType_t_core2 xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2, xResult;
 *
 *      // xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 must be initialised to pdFALSE_core2.
 *      xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 = pdFALSE_core2;
 *
 *      // Set bit 0 and bit 4 in xEventGroup_core2.
 *      xResult = xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR_core2(
 *                          xEventGroup_core2,    // The event group being updated.
 *                          BIT_0 | BIT_4   // The bits being set.
 *                          &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 );
 *
 *      // Was the message posted successfully?
 *      if( xResult == pdPASS_core2 )
 *      {
 *          // If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken_core2 is now set to pdTRUE_core2 then a context
 *          // switch should be requested.  The macro used is port specific and
 *          // will be either portYIELD_FROM_ISR_core2() or portEND_SWITCHING_ISR() -
 *          // refer to the documentation page for the port being used.

 *
 * Atomically set bits within an event group, then wait for a combination of
 * bits to be set within the same event group.  This functionality is typically
 * used to synchronise multiple tasks, where each task_core2 has to wait for the other
 * tasks to reach a synchronisation point before proceeding.
 *
 * This function cannot be used from an interrupt.
 *
 * The function will return before its block time expires if the bits specified
 * by the uxBitsToWait parameter are set, or become set within that time.  In
 * this case all the bits specified by uxBitsToWait will be automatically
 * cleared before the function returns.
 *
 * @param xEventGroup_core2 The event group in which the bits are being tested.  The
 * event group must have previously been created using a call to
 * xEventGroupCreate_core2().
 *
 * @param uxBitsToSet_core2 The bits to set in the event group before determining
 * if, and possibly waiting for, all the bits specified by the uxBitsToWait
 * parameter are set.
 *
 * @param uxBitsToWaitFor_core2 A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to test
 * inside the event group.  For example, to wait for bit 0 and bit 2 set
 * uxBitsToWaitFor_core2 to 0x05.  To wait for bits 0 and bit 1 and bit 2 set
 * uxBitsToWaitFor_core2 to 0x07.  Etc.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait_core2 The maximum amount of time (specified in 'ticks') to wait
 * for all of the bits specified by uxBitsToWaitFor_core2 to become set.
 *
 * @return The value of the event group at the time either the bits being waited
 * for became set, or the block time expired.  Test the return value to know
 * which bits were set.  If xEventGroupSync_core2() returned because its timeout
 * expired then not all the bits being waited for will be set.  If
 * xEventGroupSync_core2() returned because all the bits it was waiting for were
 * set then the returned value is the event group value before any bits were
 * automatically cleared.
